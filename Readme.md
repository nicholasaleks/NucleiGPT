NucleiGPT leverages the power of Embeddings & Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform vulnerability data from diverse sources into actionable Nuclei templates. This project is intended to help security professionals automate the process of codifying vulnerabilities into Nuclei templates.

Check out our detailed [blog article](https://www.asec.io/blog/nucleiGPT-automated-vulnerability-codification) that dives into the engineering aspects and design decisions behind the project.


## 🌟 Features

- **CVE to Nuclei Template**: Turn common vulnerability exposures into actionable templates. (This will even attempt to convert CVEs that are not yet supported by ProjectDiscovery's Nuclei Templates repository.)
- **Pentest to Nuclei Template**: Transform pentest pdf reports into standardized Nuclei Templates.
- **HackerOne to Nuclei Template**: Convert bug bounty findings from HackerOne into ready-to-use templates.
